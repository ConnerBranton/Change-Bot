C# Change-Bot

This is a C# kiosk project I created with a partner that will:
1) Prompt the user like a self checkout
2) Keep track of bills inserted and disposed using a "till".
3) Dispose proper change if needed
4) Run a card number and see if it is a 'real card number'
5) There is a randomizer incorporated to prompt you if the card was accepted for the full amount.
